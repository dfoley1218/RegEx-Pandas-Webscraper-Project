This project analyzes the word frequency in Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech delivered on August 28, 1963. The goal is to extract the text from the speech, clean it, and count the occurrences of each word to understand the most frequently used terms.

Features
Web Scraping: Uses BeautifulSoup and requests to extract the speech text from a webpage.

Text Cleaning: Removes punctuation, converts text to lowercase, and handles line breaks for accurate word counting.

Word Frequency Analysis: Splits the cleaned text into individual words and counts their occurrences using pandas.

Data Export: Saves the word frequency results to a CSV file for further analysis.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries:

BeautifulSoup

requests

re

pandas

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install the required libraries:

bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook RegEx Pandas Web Scraper Project.ipynb.

The notebook will:

Scrape the speech text from the provided URL.

Clean the text by removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.

Split the text into words and count their frequencies.

Export the results to a CSV file named speech.csv.

Results
The output CSV file contains two columns:

Word: The word from the speech.

Count: The number of times the word appears.

Example Output
Word	Count
the	54
of	49
to	29
and	27
a	20
...	...
Insights
The most frequent words (e.g., "the", "of", "to") are common stopwords, but the analysis also highlights key terms like "freedom", "dream", and "justice" that are central to the speech.

The word "dream" appears frequently, reflecting the speech's iconic theme.

Future Enhancements
Remove common stopwords to focus on meaningful terms.

Visualize word frequencies using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.

Perform sentiment analysis to explore the emotional tone of the speech.
